        // how hard to rig the button so that when done it will trigger/increase the encode badge? probably should just code it to add it lol
        // also need a way to delete texts/verses. I guess that's the Encode list. though if doing similar texts, one might want to copy/dup a text in the add tab. 
        // yeah, would make sense to be able to see a list of texts in AddView, especially like an Example, then select Duplicate or Add Text from
        // for non-examples, it would be like Duplicate. Hmm; maybe wait until MVP. though will def need Delete verse function by then.
