How important are words to you?

Maybe you were having a bad day. Like, a really bad day. And someone said something that pulled you back up.

Or maybe you were feeling … lost. And you read something. It made you laugh. Or cry.

Either way, the words were important. 

Someday, you’ll have another bad day. Or feel lost. It happens. 

What if those restoring words—what if you could *know* them? Could drive to work while building a mental map? Could lay in bed while turning them over in your mind? Could go to sleep and dream about them?

You provide the text. Versed helps you memorize it. 


Versed uses ideas from memory research:

• The more we challenge ourselves, the more our brain learns.
  • Consider highlighting, re-reading, and taking notes. How challenging is that, really?
  • Now consider a fill-in-the-blanks quiz where you have to dictate an entire sentence. That’s where the rubber meets the road. 
            
• Cadence
  • Why do we recognize songs with just a few notes? Why do we get a tune stuck in our heads? 
  • There’s something about the added structure of a poem or song that helps our brain stay hooked onto it. With Versed, you can format text to provide the most cadence to you.
                            
• Cramming fails. Sleep.
  • Repeating something x10 is inefficient. Once you remember something correctly (e.g., a fill-in-the-blanks quiz), get some quality sleep. You need that for long-term memory. And that’s all you need.
                            
• Quiz yourself. But less often.
  • Here’s a secret win-win: When you quiz yourself less, your brain remembers your answers *more*. Because it’s more challenging. 
  • So, you win once by spending less time on quizzes. And you win again by remembering the correct answers longer! 
  • How often to quiz yourself? Versed handles it. 


What if you could recite an entire parable to yourself? Or to a friend? 

What about a psalm? A poem? A speech?

Versed is designed to scale to longer texts.

Versed. Because words are important.
